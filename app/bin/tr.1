NAME
       tr - transliterate characters

USAGE
       tr from to [+start] [-end] [filein [fileout]]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the   UZIX   version   of	 tr. It's
       been significantly  scaled  down for inclusion in the UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release. In addition, many options are
       missing from this release.

       Tr transliterates characters from filein to  fileout.  The
       characters for transliterating are "from",  and	those  to
       transliterate into are "to". "start" is the start position
       for transliteration and "end" is the ending  position  for
       transliteration. If "from" has the same	length	of  "to",
       characters in "to" are substituted by  the  characters  in
       "from". If "to" is not given, the characters in "from" are
       simply deleted from filein.If length of "from" are greater
       than "to",all characterss in "from" beyond the last one to
       match up with one in "to" translate into the last char  in
       "to",  but   any  stream  of  consecutive   characters  so
       translated  is  reduced	to  just  one  occurence  of  the
       resulting char.

SYNTAX
       The recognized escape sequences are \r, \n, \t, \f, \b, \s
       and \ddd. For ranges, a-e is the same as abcde (but e-a is
       an empty range).

       There are also the following recognized classes:

       :z empty range
       :a is the same as a-zA-Z.
       :l is the same as a-z.
       :u is the same as A-Z.
       :m is the same as  -ï.
       :b is the same as €-Ÿ.
       :r is the same as  -ï€-Ÿ.
       :d is the same as 0-9.
       :n is the same as a-zA-Z0-9.
       :s is the range \001-\040.
       :. is the range including all ASCII other then \0.

       For negation, if the first character of "from" is '^',then
       any characters not in "from" match. In this case,"to" must
       be null or only a single character.
