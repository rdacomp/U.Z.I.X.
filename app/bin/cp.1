NAME
       cp - copy files

USAGE
       cp source... destination

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of  cp.	It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.Also, all options are missing.

       If the last argument names an existing directory,cp copies
       each other given file into a file with the  same  name  in
       that directory. Otherwise, if only two files are given, it
       copies  the  first onto the second.  It is an error if the
       last argument is not a directory and more than  two  files
       are given.  By default, it does not copy directories.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
