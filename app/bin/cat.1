NAME
       cat - concatenate files and print on standard output

USAGE
       cat filenames

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the   UZIX   version   of	cat. It's
       been significantly  scaled  down for inclusion in the UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release. In addition, all options  are
       missing from this release.

       cat simply displays files on standard output.  All  output
       may be piped in many ways, this is where the power lies.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
