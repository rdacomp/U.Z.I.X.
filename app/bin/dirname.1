NAME
       dirname - strip non-directory suffix from filename

USAGE
       dirname filename

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of  dirname.   It's
       been significantly  scaled  down for inclusion in the UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.

       dirname prints all but the final slash-delimited component
       of {filename}. If {filename} is a single component,dirname
       prints '.' (meaning the current directory).

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Basename is complete except for the
       --version and --help options.
