NAME
       doswrite - write a file onto an MS(X)-DOS diskette

USAGE
       doswrite [-a] drive dosfile [uzixfile]

DESCRIPTION
       doswrite writes its stdin or a specific UZIX  file  to  an
       MS(X)-DOS file.The diskette or partition must be formatted
       and  have  an  MS(X)-DOS  file system  already  in  place,
       including all the directories leading up to the file.

       A drive code of A causes the program to use /dev/dosA, for
       example, a link to /dev/fd0.  Similarly, to have hard disk
       partition 1 be DOS drive C, /dev/dosC could be a  link  to
       /dev/hd1, and so on for other drive codes. A normal device
       name may also be used instead of a drive code. And,  also,
       a drive code of A: causes the  program  to  use  /dev/fd0.
       Similarly, a drive code of C: causes the  program  to  use
       /dev/fd2. Yet, you can join drive code and dosfile in  one
       argument, as A:DOSFILE.TXT or C:FUDEBA.ASC, etc.

OPTIONS
       -a     ASCII file.
