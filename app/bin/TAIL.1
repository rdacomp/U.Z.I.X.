NAME
       tail - print the last few lines of a file

USAGE
       tail [-c n | -n n] [-f] [file] ...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version  of tail. It's been
       scaled down for inclusion in the UZIX release, and doesn't
       have the help or version  commands  included  in  the  GNU
       release. Also, many options are missing.

       tail print last  few lines  of  one  or  more  files.  The
       default count is 10 lines.  The default file is  stdin. If
       the value of n for the -c or -n  flags  starts  with  a  +
       sign,  counting  starts  at the beginning, rather than the
       end of the file.

OPTIONS
       -c     The count refers to characters.

       -f     On FIFO or special file, keep reading after EOF.

       -n     The count refers to lines.
