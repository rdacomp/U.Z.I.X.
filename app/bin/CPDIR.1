DESCRIPTION

       release. Also, some options are missing.

       cise copy of a directory tree.

OPTIONS
       -i     Prompt whether to overwrite existing regular desti-
              nation files.

       -f     Remove existing destination files.

       -v     Print the name of each file before copying it.

       -x     Skip  subdirectories that are on different filesys-
              tems from the one that the copy started on.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Some options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
