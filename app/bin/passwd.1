DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of passwd.It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.Also, all options are missing.

       With passwd, you can change your password on system.If you
       are  the  root,	you  can  change  any  user  password  by
       specifing the user in the command line.passwd asks for the
       old password and twice  for  the  new  password.  Then  it
       changes the password on the system.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
