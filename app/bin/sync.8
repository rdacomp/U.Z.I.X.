NAME
       sync - flush filesystem buffers

USAGE
       sync

DESCRIPTION
       Sync flushes any pending cache writes to your disk.Sync is
       generally called before a system shutdown, etc..  although
       using the proper command will ensure that  the  dirty  bit
       on the filesystem is set to clean,  which  stops un-needed
       disk checks at bootup.
