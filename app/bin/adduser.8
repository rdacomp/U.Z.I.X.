NAME
       adduser - add a user to the system

USAGE
       adduser

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  a	specified user,  called  username, to the system.

       After executed, the program will ask the user  login,  his
       full  name,  his  group	 ID,  user  ID,  home  directory,
       default shell and password. Except for the login and  full
       name, all other questions have default values that will be
       used if you don't type anything.

       You must be the root to add a new user to the system.

LIMITATIONS
       User  names  must  be 8 characters or fewer long, and must
       contain only letters or numbers.

       Obvious passwords are accepted.

       Shadow password system is not supported.

BUGS
       This  version  has  been  scaled  down  a  little  bit for
       inclusion in the UZIX. As  adduser  vary  from  system  to
       system, it's not a big problem, since it  does  what  it's
       supposed to.
