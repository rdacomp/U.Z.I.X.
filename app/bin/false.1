FALSE(1)	       UZIX Shell Utilities		 FALSE(1)


NAME
       false - do nothing, return unsuccessfully

USAGE
       false

DESCRIPTION
       False simply displays nothing, but returns with	an  error
       status of '1', meaning that an error has occured.  It  can
       be used as  a  placeholder  in  shell  scripts,	where  an
       unsuccessful command return is required.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX.  False  is  complete except for the
       --version and --help options.
