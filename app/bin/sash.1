NAME
       sash - stand-alone shell with built-in commands

USAGE
       sash

DESCRIPTION
       The  sash  program  is a stand-alone shell.

       Sash  can  execute  external  programs,	as  in any shell.
       There are no restrictions on these commands.Also, external
       programs can be runned  in  background  if called with the
       last argument being a "&".

       More importantly, however, is that many	of  the  standard
       system commands are built-in to sash.  These built-in com-
       mands are:

	    chgrp, chmod, chown, cmp, cp, dd, echo,
	    ed, grep, kill, ln, ls, mkdir, mknod,
	    more, mount, mv, printenv, pwd, rm, rmdir,
	    sync, tar, touch, umount

       These commands are generally similar to the standard  pro-
       grams  with  similar names.  However, they are simpler and
       cruder than the external programs,  and	so  many  of  the
       options	are  not  implemented.	The restrictions for each
       built-in command are described later.

       For  any  command,   filenames	are   expanded	 so  that
       asterisks, question marks, and characters inside of square
       brackets  are  recognised  and  are expanded.  However, no
       other command line processing is performed.  This includes
       quoting	of arguments, specifying of file redirection, and
       the specifying of a pipeline.

       The "help" command will list all of the built-in  commands
       in sash.Note that sash can be compiled only with a part of
       all builtin commands, due to memory usage problems.Use the
       "help"	command  to  know  what  built-in  commands   are
       available.

COMMANDS
       alias [name [command] ]
	      If name and command are provided, this defines an
	      alias  for a command with the specified name, which
	      executes the specified command, with possible argu-
	      ments.   If just name is provided, then the defini-
	      tion of the specified command alias  is  displayed.
	      If nothing is provided, then the definitions of all
	      aliases are displayed.   When  defining  an  alias,
	      wildcards are not expanded.

       cat filenames
	      Type out the contents of the  specified  filenames.

       cd [dirname]
	      If dirname is provided, then the current directory
	      is changed to the dirname.  If dirname is  absent,
	      then the current directory is changed to the user's
	      home directory  (value  of  the  $HOME  environment
	      variable).

       chgrp gid filename ....
	      Change  the  group  id  for  the	specified list of
	      files.  The gid can either be a group  name,  or	a
	      decimal value.

       chmod mode filename ....
	      Change  the  mode  of  the specified list of files.
	      The mode argument can only be an octal value.

       chown uid filename ....
	      Change the owner	id  for  the  specified  list  of
	      files.   The uid can  either be a user name, or a
	      decimal value.

       cmp filename filename
	      Determines whether or not the  specified	filenames
	      have  identical data.  This says that the files are
	      links to each other, are different sizes, differ at
	      a particular byte number, or are identical.

       cp srcname ... destname
	      Copies  one  or  more files from the srcname to the
	      destname.  If more than one srcname is given, or if
	      destname	is a directory, then all the srcnames are
	      copied into the destname directory  with	the  same
	      names as the srcnames.

       dd if=source of=dest [bs=n] [count=n] [skip=n] [seek=n]
	      Copy  data from one file to another with the speci-
	      fied parameters.	The if and of arguments  must  be
	      provided,  so stdin and stdout cannot be specified.
	      The bs argument is the block size, and is a numeric
	      value  (which defaults to 512 bytes). Count is the
	      number of blocks to be copied  (which  defaults  to
	      end  of file for the input file).  Skip is the num-
	      ber of blocks to ignore  before  copying	(seek  is
	      used  if	possible, and the default is 0). Seek is
	      the number of blocks to seek  in	the  output  file
	      before  writing  (and  defaults  to 0).  Any of the
	      numeric decimal values can have one or more  trail-
	      ing  letters  from  the set 'kbw', which multiplies
	      the value by 1024, 512, and  2  respectively.   The
	      command  reports the number of full blocks read and
	      written, and whether or not any partial  block  was
	      read or written.

       echo [args] ....
	      Echo the arguments to the echo command.  Wildcards
	      are expanded, so this is convenient to get a  quick
	      list  of	filenames  in a directory.  The output is
	      always terminated with a newline.

       ed [filename]
	      Edit the specified file using  line-mode	commands.
	      The following ed commands are provided: = c r w i a
	      d p l s f k z and q.   Line  numbers  can  be  con-
	      stants,  ".", "$", "'x", /string/ and simple arith-
	      metic combinations of these.  The  substitute  com-
	      mand and the search expression can only use literal
	      strings.	There are some small differences  in  the
	      way that some commands behave.

       exec filename [args]
	      Execute  the  specified  program with the specified
	      arguments.  This replaces sash completely  by  the
	      executed program.

       exit   Quit from sash

       grep [-i] word filename ....
	      Display  lines of the specified files which contain
	      the given word.  If only	one  filename  is  given,
	      then  only the matching lines are printed.  If mul-
	      tiple filenames are given, then the  filenames  are
	      printed  along  with the matching lines. Word must
	      be a single word, (ie, not a  regular  expression).
	      If -i is given, then case is ignored when doing the
	      search.  If -n is given, then the line  numbers  of
	      the matching lines are also printed.

       help   Displays a list of available built-in commands.

       kill [-signal] pid ....
	      Sends the specified signal to the specified list of
	      processes.  Signal is a numberic value, or  one  of
	      the special values HUP, INT, QUIT, or KILL.

       ln [-s] srcname .... destname
	      Links  one  or  more  files from the srcname to the
	      specified destname.  If  there  are  multiple  src-
	      names, or destname is a directory, then the link is
	      put in the destname directory with the same name as
	      the source name.	The default links are hard links.
	      Using -s makes symbolic links.  For symbolic links,
	      only one srcname can be specified.

       ls [-lid] filename ....
	      Display information about the specified filesnames,
	      which may be directories. sash can be compiled with
	      two tipes os built-in ls command: a simple ls and a
	      more complex ls. For  the  simple  ls,  the  normal
	      listing is simply a list	of  filenames,	each  one
	      followed by a classification character (* for execu
	      tables, @ for soft links and / for directories).The
	      only option available is -la, that produces a  long
	      listing with size, permissions, links,  inode   and
	      filename. Otherwise, for the more complex ls  built
	      in command, the  normal  listing is simply  a  list
	      of  filenames,  one per line. The options available
	      are  -l,	-i,  and  -d.	The  -l  option  produces
	      a  long  listing given the normal 'ls' information.
	      The -i option also displays  the	inode  numbers of
	      the files. The -d option displays information about
	      a directory, instead of the files within it.

       mkdir dirname ....
	      Creates  the  specified directories.  They are cre-
	      ated with the default permissions.

       mknod filename type major minor
	      Creates a special device node, either  a	character
	      file  or a block file. Filename is the name of the
	      node.  Type is either 'c' or  'd'. Major is the
	      major  device  number. Minor is the minor device
	      number.  Both of these numbers are decimal.

       more filename ....
	      Type out the contents of the  specified  filenames,
	      one  page  at a time.  For each page displayed, you
	      can type 'n' to go to the  next  file, 'p' to go to
	      the previous file,space bar to go to the next page,
	      return to go to the next line or 'q'  to	quit  the
	      command completely.

       mount [-r] devname dirnaem
	      Mount a filesystem on a  directory  name.   The  -r
	      option  specifies   that	the  filesystem  must  be
	      mounted as read-only.

       mv srcname .... destname
	      Moves one or more files from  the  srcname  to  the
	      destname.   If  multiple	srcnames are given, or if
	      destname is a  directory,  then  the  srcnames  are
	      copied into the destination directory with the same
	      names  as  the  srcnames.   Renames  are	attempted
	      first, but if this fails because of the files being
	      on different filesystems, then a copies and deletes
	      are done instead.

       printenv [name]
	      If name is not given, this prints out the values of
	      all the current environment variables.  If name  is
	      given, then only that environment variable value is
	      printed.

       prompt [word] ....
	      Sets the prompt string  that  is	displayed  before
	      reading  of  a command.  A space is always added to
	      the specified prompt.

       pwd
	      Prints the current working directory.

       quit
	      Exits from sash.

       rm filename ....
	      Removes one or more files.

       rmdir dirname ....
	      Removes one or more directories.	 The  directories
	      must be empty for this to be successful.

       setenv name value
	      Set the value of an environment variable.

       source filename
	      Execute  commands which are contained in the speci-
	      fied filename.

       sync
	      Do a "sync" system call to force dirty  blocks  out
	      to the disk.

       tar [-xtvf] devname [filename] ....
	      List  or	restore  files	from a tar archive.  This
	      command can only read tar files, not  create  them.
	      The  available options are xtvf.	The f option must
	      be specified, and accepts a  device  or  file  name
	      argument	which  contains  the  tar archive.  If no
	      filename is given, all files  in	the  archive  are
	      listed  or  extracted.  Otherwise, only those files
	      starting with the  specified  filenames  are  done.
	      Leading  slashes	in  the tar archive filenames are
	      removed.

       touch filename ....
	      Updates the modify times of the specifed files.  If
	      a file does not exist, then it will be created with
	      the default protection.

       umask [mask]
	      If mask is given, sets the "umask" value	used  for
	      initializing   the  permissions  of  newly  created
	      files.  If mask is  not  given,  then  the  current
	      umask  value  is	printed.   The	mask  is an octal
	      value.

       umount filename
	      Unmounts a file system.  The filename can either be
	      the  device  name  which	is  mounted,  or else the
	      directory name which the	file  system  is  mounted
	      onto.

       unalias name
	      Remove the definition for the specified alias.
