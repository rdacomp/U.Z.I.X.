NAME
       rm - remove files

USAGE
       rm filenames

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the   UZIX   version  of rmdir. It's
       been significantly  scaled  down for inclusion in the UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release. In addition, all options  are
       missing.

       rm simply deletes files. You may have  wildcards,  but  be
       very careful, it doesn't prompt,and with a simple command,
       you could delete your whole disk.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.

       It's also missing the -i  option,  which  means	it  won't
       prompt, so please proceed with caution.
