USAGE
       chown uid filenames

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of chown. It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.Also, all options are missing.

       chown changes the  user	ownership  of  each  given  file,
       according to its first argument, that can be  the  numeric
       user ID or the user login.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
