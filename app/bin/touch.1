NAME
       touch - change file timestamps

USAGE
       touch [-c] [-d time] [-m] filenames

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the   UZIX   version  of touch. It's
       been significantly  scaled  down for inclusion in the UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.

       Touch changes the timestamp on files. Files  that  do  not
       exist are created empty.

OPTIONS
       -c do not create files that do not exist.

       -d {time} Use {time} instead of the current time.Time must
       be in the form HH:MM:SS DD/MM/YY. Values don't need to  be
       2 digits exaclty. The hour vary from 0 to 23 and year  can
       also be 4 digits.

       -m change the modification time only.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
