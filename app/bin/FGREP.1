NAME
       fgrep - fast and fixed-expression grep

USAGE
       fgrep [-cfhlnsv] [string_file] [string] [file] ...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of fgrep. It's been
       scaled down for inclusion in the UZIX release, and doesn't
       have the help or version  commands  included  in  the  GNU
       release. Also, some options are missing.

       fgrep is essentially the same as grep, except that it only
       searches for lines containing literal strings (no wildcard
       characters).  The pattern may  consist  of  several  lines
       with one string to search on each line.
 
OPTIONS
       -c     Count  matching lines and only print count, not the
              lines.

       -f     Take strings from file named in following argument.

       -h     Omit file headers from printout.

       -l     List file names once only.

       -n     Each line is preceded by its line number.

       -s     Status only, no output.

       -v     Print only lines not matching.
 
BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Some options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
