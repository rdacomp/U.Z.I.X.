USAGE

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of cgrep. It's been
       scaled down for inclusion in the UZIX release, and doesn't
       have the help or version  commands  included  in  the  GNU
       release. Also, some options are missing.

       cgrep  is  a  program  like  grep, except that it also can
       print a few lines above and/or below the  matching  lines.
       It also prints the line numbers of the output.

OPTIONS
       -a     How many lines to display after the matching line.

       -b     How many lines to display before the matching line.

       -f     Suppress file name in the output.

       -l     Lines are truncated to this length before  compari-
              son.

       -n     Suppress line numbers in the output.

       -w     Sets window size (same as -a n -b n).

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Some options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
