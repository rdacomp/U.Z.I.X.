NAME
       echo - display a line of text

USAGE
       echo [-ne] [string ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of  basename.  It's
       been significantly  scaled  down for inclusion in the UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.

       echo writes each given string to the standard output, with
       a space between them and a newline after the last one.

OPTIONS
       -n do not output the trailing newline.

       -e enable  interpretation  of  the  following   backslash-
	  escaped characters in the strings:
	      \a    alert (bell)
	      \b    backspace
	      \c    suppress trailing newline
	      \f    form feed
	      \n    new line
	      \r    carriage return
	      \t    horizontal tab
	      \v    vertical tab
	      \\    backslash
	      \nnn  the character whose ASCII code is nnn (octal)
	      \xnn  the character whose ASCII code is nn (hex)

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Echo  is	complete  except  for the
       --version and --help options.
