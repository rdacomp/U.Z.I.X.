NAME
       dd - convert a file while copying it

USAGE
       dd if=name of=name [bs=n] [count=n] [skip=n] [seek=n]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version  of  dd.	It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.Also,many options are missing.

       dd copies a file with  a  user-selectable blocksize, while
       optionally performing conversions on it.

OPTIONS
       Numbers can be followed by a multiplier:
       b=512, c=1, k=1024, w=2, xm=number m

       if=name
	      Read from file.

       of=file
	      Write to	file. Truncate file to the size specified
	      by seek= (0 bytes if  seek=  is  not  given).

       bs=bytes
	      Read  and write bytes bytes at a time.

       skip=blocks

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
