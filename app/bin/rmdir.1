NAME
       rmdir - remove empty directories

USAGE
       rmdir [-p] directories

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the   UZIX   version  of rmdir. It's
       been significantly  scaled  down for inclusion in the UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.

       rmdir deletes empty directories from your disk.The command
       isn't dangerous, as it will only remove empty directories,
       not full ones.

OPTIONS
       -p removes any  parent  directories  that  are  explicitly
       mentioned in the argument, if they become empty after  the
       argument file is removed.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the  UZIX.	Only  the  --help  and	--version
       commands are missing from this release (and  the  extended
       GNU equivilants, ie: --parents).
