NAME
       diff - print differences between two files

USAGE
       diff [-c | -e | -C n] [-br] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of  diff. It's been
       scaled down for inclusion in the UZIX release, and doesn't
       have the help or version  commands  included  in  the  GNU
       release. Also, some options are missing.

       diff  compares  two  files  and  generates a list of lines
       telling how the two files differ.  Lines may not be longer
       than 128 characters.  If the two  arguments on the command
       line are both directories, diff recursively steps  through
       all  subdirectories comparing files of the same name. If a
       file name is found only in  one  directory,  a  diagnostic
       message  is  written  to  stdout. A file that is of either
       block special, character special  or  FIFO  special  type,
       cannot  be compared to any other file.  On the other hand,
       if there is one directory and one file given on  the  com-
       mand  line,  diff  tries to compare the file with the same
       name as file in the directory directory.

OPTIONS
       -C n   Produce output that contains n lines of context.

       -b     Ignore white space when comparing.

       -c     Produce output that contains three lines of context

       -e     Produce an ed-script to convert file1 into file2.

       -r     Apply diff recursively to files and directories  of
              the same  name,  when  file1  and  file2  are  both
              directories.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Some options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
