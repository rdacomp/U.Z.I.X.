NAME
       time - report how long a command takes

USAGE
       time command [command arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents  the UZIX version of time. It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release. Also, all options are missing.

       The  command is executed and the real time, user time, and
       system time (in hours, minutes, and seconds) are  printed.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from other time versions.
