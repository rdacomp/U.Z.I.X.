NAME
       fld - read and concatenate fields from in file

USAGE
       fld -u -z* -[b t s? i? fm1.n1,m2.n2] {infiles} [> outfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the   UZIX   version   of	fld. It's
       been significantly  scaled  down for inclusion in the UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release. Also, quite a few options are
       missing.

       Fld read a file,concatenates user-defined fields from this
       file and output them to the standard output.

OPTIONS
       -? or -h shows help.
       -u unpack tabs.
       -p pack tabs.
       -z* skip first * spaces.
       -b skip leading blanks of field.
       -t remove trailing spaces of field.
       -s? declares the output fields separator as '?'(it will be
       printed after the mentioned field).
       -i? declares the input fields separator as as '?'.
       -fm1.n1,m2.n2 defines field.
       -f# gets field from user input.

       The values after "-f" define starting and  ending position
       of field: m1.n1 is field start (first char of field);m2.n2
       is the field end(first char not in field).Value 'm' define
       the number of fields, skipped from begin of line  (0 means
       no skip). The value 'n' define the number of chars,skipped
       in selected field. If "m1.n1" is omitted,field starts from
       line begin. If "m2.n2" is omitted, the field  continues to
       line end. Excluding omitted "m2.n2", omitting any of  four
       values means "use 0 for this value".If defined -b, heading
       spaces will  be	skipped  after	'm', but  before  'n'  is
       applyed.
