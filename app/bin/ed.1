       ed filename

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the   UZIX   version   of	ed.  It's
       been significantly  scaled  down for inclusion in the UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release. In addition, many options are
       missing from this release.

       Ed is a line based textfile editor for UNIX.It can be used
       to create, edit, and manipulate text based/readable files.

       If ed is involked with a {filename}  specified,	it  opens
       this file if it exists, or creates it, and will use it  as
       the current document. Upon quitting ed,	any  changes  not
       saved using the 'w' command will be lost.

       Ed is similar to vi in many respects; in fact one  of  the
       only major  differences	is  that  ed's	line  based.  So,
       naturally, when you involke ed, it starts in command mode.

       When an input command is issued, it  switches  into  input
       mode (a=append, i=insert, c=change). In input mode you can
       type and it will be added to the file.Command mode is used
       explicitly for entering commands, and no input work can be
       done there.
