       cmp - compare files

USAGE
       cmp file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of  cmp.	It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.Also, all options are missing.

       cmp compares file1 and file2 and tell what file is bigger.
       If files are equal sized, cmp tells what is  the  position
       of the first byte that differs the files.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
