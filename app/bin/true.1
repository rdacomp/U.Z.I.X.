TRUE(1) 	       UZIX Shell Utilities		  TRUE(1)


NAME
       true - do nothing, return successfully

USAGE
       true

DESCRIPTION
       True simply displays nothing, but returns  with	an  error
       status of '0', meaning that the command	worked	properly.
       It can be used as a placeholder in shell scripts, where an
       successful command return is required.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX.  False  is  complete except for the
       --version and --help options.
