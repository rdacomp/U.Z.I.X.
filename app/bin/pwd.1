NAME
       pwd - print name of current/working directory

USAGE
       pwd

DESCRIPTION
       Most shells have their own built-in pwd function, so  this
       version of pwd, may never actually be executed. Pwd simply
       writes the full name of the current directory to  standard
       output.
