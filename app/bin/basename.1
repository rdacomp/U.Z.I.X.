NAME
       basename - strip directory and suffix from filenames

USAGE
       basename name [suffix]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of  basename.  It's
       been significantly  scaled  down for inclusion in the UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.

       Basename removes any  leading  directory  components  from
       {name}; If {suffix} is specified and is identical  to  the
       end of {name}, it is removed from {name} as well. Basename
       prints it's resulting output to stdout.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Basename is complete except for the
       --version and --help options.
