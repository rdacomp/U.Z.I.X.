NAME
       dhrystone - integer benchmark

USAGE
       dhrystone

DESCRIPTION
       Many  years  ago,  a floating-point benchmark called whet-
       stone  was  popular  for  benchmarking  FORTRAN  programs.
       Nowadays,  an integer benchmark called dhrystone is widely
       used for benchmarking  UNIX  systems.   This  is  it.   Be
       warned, however, that dhrystone is entirely CPU bound, and
       goes blindingly fast on machines with  high-speed  caches.
       Although  this  is  a good measure for programs that spend
       most of their time in some inner loop, it is a poor bench-
       mark for I/O bound applications.
