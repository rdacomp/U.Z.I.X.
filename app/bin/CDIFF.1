NAME
       cdiff - context diff

USAGE
       cdiff [-cn] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of cdiff. It's been
       scaled down for inclusion in the UZIX release, and doesn't
       have the help or version  commands  included  in  the  GNU
       release. Also, some options are missing.

       cdiff  produces  a  context diff by first running diff and
       then adding context.  Some update  programs,  like  patch,
       can  use  context diffs to update files, even in the pres-
       ence of other, independent changes.

OPTIONS
       -cn    Provide n lines of context.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Some options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
