NAME
       top - display top CPU processes

USAGE
       top [-d delay][-q][-s][-i]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents  the  UZIX version of top. It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release. Also, some options are missing.

       top provides an ongoing look at processor activity in real
       time.  It displays a listing  of  the  most  CPU-intensive
       tasks on the system, and can provide an interactive inter-
       face for manipulating processes. Most features  can either
       be selected by an interactive command. See below for  more
       information.

OPTIONS
       d    Specifies  the delay between screen updates.  You can
	    change this with the s interactive command.

       q    This causes top to refresh without any delay.

       s    Tells top to run in secure mode.  This  disables  the
	    potentially  dangerous  of	the  interactive commands
	    (see below).  A secure top is a nifty thing to  leave
	    running on a spare terminal.

       i    Start  top ignoring any idle or zombie processes. See
	    the interactive command i below.

FIELD DESCRIPTIONS
       top displays a variety of information about the	processor
       state.  The display is updated every 5 seconds by default,
       but you can change that with the d command-line option  or
       the s interactive command.

       processes
	    The  total number of processes running at the time of
	    the last update.  This is also broken down	into  the
	    number of tasks which are running, sleeping, stopped,
	    or undead. The processes display  may  be  toggled by
	    the t interactive command.

       Mem  Statistics on memory usage, including total available
	    memory, free memory, used memory and  kernel  memory.
	    The display of memory information may be  toggled  by
	    the m interactive command.

       PID  The process ID of each task.

       PPID The parent process ID of each task.

       USER The user name of the task's owner.

       SIZE The  size  of  the	task's	code plus data plus stack
	    space, in kilobytes, is shown here.

       STAT The state of the task is shown  here.  The	state  is
	    either sleeping,  running,	zombie,  forking,  ready,
	    paused or wainting for.

       WCHAN
	    depending	 on    the    availablity    of    either
	    /boot/psdatabase or the kernel  link  map  /boot/Sys-
	    tem.map  this  shows  the  address or the name of the
	    kernel function the task currently is sleeping in.

       TIME Total CPU time the task has used  since  it  started.

       %CPU The  task's  share	of  the  CPU  time since the last
	    screen update, expressed as a percentage of total CPU
	    time.

       %MEM The task's share of the physical memory.

       COMMAND
	    The  task's  command name.

INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
       Several	single-key  commands  are recognized while top is
       running.  Some are disabled if the s option has been given
       on the command line.

       ^L   Clear the screen.

       h or ?
	    Displays a help screen giving a brief summary of com-
	    mands.

       k    Kill  a process.  You will be prompted for the PID of
	    the task, and the signal to send to it.  For a normal
	    kill, send signal 15.  For a sure, but rather abrupt,
	    kill, send signal 9.  The  default	signal,  as  with
	    kill(1),  is 15, SIGTERM.  This command is not avail-
	    able in secure mode.

       i    Ignore idle and zombie processes.  This is	a  toggle
	    switch.

       n or #
	    Change  the number of processes to show.  You will be
	    prompted to enter the number.  This  overrides  auto-
	    matic  determination  of  the  number of processes to
	    show, which is based on window size measurement.   If
	    0  is specified, then top will show as many processes
	    as will fit on the screen; this is the default.

       q    Quit.

       s    Change  the  delay	between  updates.   You  will  be
	    prompted to enter the delay time, in seconds, between
	    updates.  Entering	 0   causes  continuous  updates.
	    The default value is 5 seconds.  Note that low values
	    cause nearly unreadably fast  displays,  and  greatly
	    raise  the	load.	This  command is not available in
	    secure mode.

       m    toggle display of memory information.

       t    toggle  display  of processes summary.

NOTES
       %CPU shows the cputime/realtime percentage in  the  period
       of  time  process was running.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from other top versions.
