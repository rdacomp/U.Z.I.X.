MAN(1)			   UZIX System Manual		   MAN(1)

NAME
       man - format and display the on-line manual pages

USAGE
       man -wqv [section] name

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version  of man.	It's been
       scaled  down  for  inclusion  in  the  UZIX  release,  and
       doesn't have the help or version commands included  in the
       GNU release. Also, some options are missing.

       man formats and displays the on-line  manual  pages.  This
       version knows about  the  MANPATH  and  PAGER  environment
       variables, so you can have your own set(s) of personal man
       pages and choose whatever program you like to display  the
       formatted pages.If section is specified, man only looks in
       that section of the manual.

	You may also specify the order to search the sections for
	entries and which preprocessors  to  run  on  the  source
	files via command line options or environment variables.

	If name contains  a  /	then  it  is  first  tried  as	a
	filename, so  that  you  can  do  "man ./foo.5"  or  even
	"man /cd/foo/bar.1.gz" .

OPTIONS
	-w
	   Only display the files that match the section/name pair.

	-v
	   Verbose mode, complain about bad formatter commands.

	-q
	   Quiet mode, no complaints about bad formatter commands.

ENVIRONMENT
	MANPATH
	   If MANPATH is set, its value is used as  the  path  to
	   search for manual pages.

	MANSECT
	   If MANSECT is set,its value is used to determine which
	   manual sections to search.

	PAGER
	   If PAGER is set, its value is used as the name of  the
	   program to use to display the man page.  If not,  then
	   /usr/bin/more is used.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.

       df doesn't show the mounting point of mounted filesystems,
       except for the root fs.
