NAME
       tee  - read from standard input and write to a file

USAGE
       tee filename

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version  of tee.	It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.Also, all options are missing.

       The tee command copies  the standard  input  to	the  file
       given as argument.

       If the file being written to does not already exist, it is
       created. If the file being written to already  exists, the
       data  it previously contained is overwritten.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
