NAME
       sum - compute the checksum and block count of a file

USAGE
       sum [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version  of sum.  It's been
       scaled down for inclusion in the UZIX release, and doesn't
       have the help or version  commands  included  in  the  GNU
       release. Also, all options are missing.

       sum  computes  the  checksum  of one or more files.  It is
       most often used to see  if  a  file  copied  from  another
       machine  has  been correctly received.  This program works
       best when both machines use the same  checksum  algorithm.

BUGS
       This version  has  been  scaled  down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Some options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
