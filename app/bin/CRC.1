NAME
       crc - print the checksum of the file data

USAGE
       crc file ...

DESCRIPTION
       The checksum of each argument  is  computed  and  printed,
       along  with  the  file  length  and its name, one file per
       line.  This program is useful for seeing if a file  trans-
       mitted  to  another  machine has arrived correctly.  It is
       conceptually  similar  to cksum, except  that  it  uses  a
       stronger checksum algorithm and also prints the length.

SEE ALSO
       cksum(1), sum(1)
