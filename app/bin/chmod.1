NAME
       chmod - change the access permissions of files

USAGE
       chmod asciimode|octalmode filenames

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of chmod. It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.Also, all options are missing.

       chmod changes the permissions of each given file according
       to mode, which can be either a symbolic representation  of
       changes	to  make, or an octal number representing the bit
       pattern for the new permissions.

       The format of a symbolic mode  is  `[ugoa][+-][rwx]'.

       A combination of the letters `ugoa' controls which  users'
       access  to  the file will be changed: the user who owns it
       (u), other users in the file's group (g), other users  not
       in  the	file's	group  (o), or all users (a).

       The  operator  `+'  causes  the permissions selected to be
       added to the existing permissions of each file; `-' causes
       them  to  be  removed.

       The letters `rwx'  select  the  new  permissions  for  the
       affected  users:  read  (r), write (w), execute (or access
       for directories) (x).

       A  numeric  mode  is  from one to four octal digits (0-7),
       derived by adding up the bits with values  4,  2,  and  1.
       Any  omitted  digits are assumed to be leading zeros.  The
       first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set	group  ID
       (2)  and save text image (1) attributes.  The second digit
       selects permissions for the user who owns the  file:  read
       (4), write (2), and execute (1); the third selects permis-
       sions for other users in the file's group, with	the  same
       values;	and  the fourth for other users not in the file's
       group, with the same values.

       chmod never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the
       chmod  system  call cannot change their permissions.  This
       is not a problem since the permissions of  symbolic  links
       are never used.	However, for each symbolic link listed on
       the command line, chmod changes	the  permissions  of  the
       pointed-to  file.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
