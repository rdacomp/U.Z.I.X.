NAME
       wc - print the number of bytes, words, and lines in files

USAGE
       wc [-pwp] [filenames]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version  of wc.	It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release. Also, a few options that many
       would expect from the GNU versions are missing  from  this
       release.

       wc counts the number of bytes, whitespace-separated words,
       and newlines in each given file, or the standard input  if
       none are given.It prints one line of counts for each file,
       and if the file was given as an argument,  it  prints  the
       filename following the counts.If more than one filename is
       given, wc prints a  final  line	containing the cumulative
       counts, with the filename `total'.  The counts are printed
       in  the	order: lines, words, bytes.

       By default, wc prints all three counts.	Options can spec-
       ify that only certain counts be printed.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
