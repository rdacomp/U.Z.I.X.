NAME
       mv - rename/move files

USAGE
       mv sourcefiles destination

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual documents  the UZIX  version of mv. It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.Also, all options are missing.

       mv simply moves	or  renames  files.  The  source  is  the
       existing files, and the destination is the  directory  you
       wish it to be moved to, or the new filename of the source.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
