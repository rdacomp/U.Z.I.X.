NAME
       dosread - read a file from an MS(X)-DOS diskette

USAGE
       dosread [-a] drive dosfile [uzixfile]

DESCRIPTION
       dosread reads one MS(X)-DOS file and writes it on standard
       output or to file uzixfile on disk. The file name must use
       slash, not backslash as a separator. ASCII files  have the
       final CTRL-Z stripped, and carriage return plus  line feed
       are mapped to line feed only.

       A drive code of A causes the program to use /dev/dosA, for
       example, a link to /dev/fd0.  Similarly, to have hard disk
       partition 1 be DOS drive C, /dev/dosC could be a  link  to
       /dev/hd1, and so on for other drive codes. A normal device
       name may also be used instead of a drive code. And,  also,
       a drive code of A: causes the  program  to  use  /dev/fd0.
       Similarly, a drive code of C: causes the  program  to  use
       /dev/fd2. Yet, you can join drive code and dosfile in  one
       argument, as A:DOSFILE.TXT or C:FUDEBA.ASC, etc.

OPTIONS
       -a     ASCII file.
