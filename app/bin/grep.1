NAME
       grep - print lines matching a pattern

USAGE
       grep -cnfv {-p<pattern>} files

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the   UZIX   version   of grep. It's
       been significantly  scaled  down for inclusion in the UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release. Also, quite a few options are
       missing.

       Grep searches the files you specify(may use wildcards) for
       the pattern you specify, and  writes  any  matches  to the
       console in the form you specify.

SYNTAX
       In the pattern yor may use following elements:

	x    - ordinary character
	\    - quotes any char
	^    - beginning of line
	$    - end of line
	.    - any char
	\nnn - numeric (C-style) value
	:l   - lower-case
	:u   - upper-case
	:a   - alphabetic
	:d   - digits
	:n   - alphanumeric
	:r   - any russian letter
	:s   - space
	:t   - tab
	:c   - any control, except LF & TAB
	:e   - start of subexpression
	*    - repeat zero or more
	+    - repeat one or more
	-    - optionally matches the expression
	[..] - any from this (may be ranges FROM-TO)
	[^..]- any except this

OPTIONS
       -c print only a count of matched lines.
       -n preceed each line by its line number.
       -f print file names.
       -v print non-matching lines.
       -p give pattern, may be repeated.

BUGS
       Since the original docs of GREP are in russian,	this  man
       page can't give more details  of  the  program  usage  and
       syntax and can't explain the error messages.

EXAMPLE
       To search all files for those whose  has  lines	with  the
       word "UZIX", I'd type:
	  grep -cf -pUZIX *
