NAME
       df - summarize free disk space

USAGE
       df [-ikn]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version  of  df.	It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.Also,many options are missing.

       df displays the amount of  disk	space  available  on  all
       currently  mounted filesystems. Disk space is shown in 512
       byte blocks by default.

OPTIONS
       -i
	      List  inode  usage  information  instead	of  block
	      usage.  An inode (short for ``index  node'')  is	a
	      special  kind  of disk block that contains informa-
	      tion about a file, such as its owner,  permissions,
	      timestamps, and location on the disk.

       -k
	      Print  sizes  in	1K  blocks  instead  of  512-byte
	      blocks.

       -n
	      Do not access /etc/mtab for getting each filesystem
	      device and mouting point. Instead, show  filesystem
	      as its position in mount table and mouting point as
	      unknown (except for root filesystem).

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.

       df doesn't show the mounting point of mounted filesystems,
       except for the root fs.
