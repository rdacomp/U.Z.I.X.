NAME
       tar - tape/disk archiving utility

USAGE
       tar [xtv]f devname [filename] ....

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the   UZIX   version   of	cat. It's
       been significantly  scaled  down for inclusion in the UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.  In  addition,  quite  a  few
       features are missing from this release.

       tar is an archiver which batches files togher. However, it
       doesn't compress. After you create the archive,	you  must
       compress it. If your not piping to tar, you  must  specify
       the f option.

       One important thing about this version of tar, is that  it
       can only read/extract/list tar files, not write to them.

EXAMPLES
       To extract all files from dog.tar, I'd type:
	   tar xf dog.tar
