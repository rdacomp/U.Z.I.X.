NAME
       mount - mount filesystems

USAGE
       mount [-r] device path

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of mount. It's been
       significantly  shortened,   but	not  many  features  have
       actually been removed. However, there may  be  differences
       from the GNU version.

       Mount will mount a filesystem  (device)	into  your  local
       filesystem.  Mount  simply  makes  your	device/filesystem
       accessable from your system, by placing the tree  of  that
       filesystem into a subdirectory on your root filesystem.

EXAMPLES
       For example, I might make the directory /floppy, and  then
       mount /dev/fd0 as /floppy. I will then be able  to  access
       and manipulate files from that floppy, and as  soon  as	I
       cd into /floppy, I know I am accessing the floppy disk.

OPTIONS
       -r Mount a filesystem in read-only mode.
