NAME
       init - process control initialization

USAGE
       /bin/init

DESCRIPTION
     Init
       Init is one of the first processes to be started  on  many
       UNIX systems. Init starts other processes,which is usually
       getty and many others after the instance of getty.

     Runlevels
       Runlevels are 'system states' of initiation.  They control
       what a computer will do when in	a  different  level,  for
       example there is a shutdown runlevel.Runlevels aren't used
       much/at all yet in UZIX,  and  more  information  will  be
       included when init can change runlevels.

     UZIX Usage
       Init is pretty limited in UZIX, it simply starts when  the
       computer starts,and terminates when the computer finishes.
       You generally won't need to worry about init, in life,  it
       should be started automagically.
