NAME
       ls - list contents of directories

SYNOPSIS
       ls [-dilfaouRF] [name...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version  of  ls.	It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.Also,many options are missing.

       ls list each given  file  or  directory	name.	Directory
       contents are sorted alphabetically.  Files are by  default
       listed in columns, sorted horizontally,	if  the  standard
       output is a terminal.

OPTIONS
       -a
	      List all files in directories, including all  files
	      that start with `.'.

       -d
	      List  directories  like  other  files,  rather than
	      listing their contents.

       -f     Do  not  sort  directory	contents;  list  them  in
	      whatever	order  they  are stored on the disk.

       -i
	      Print the index number of each file to the left  of
	      the file name.

       -l
	      In  addition  to	the  name of each file, print the
	      file type, permissions, number of hard links, owner
	      name, group name, size in bytes, and timestamp (the
	      modification time unless other times are selected).
	      For  files  with	a time that is more than 6 months
	      old or more than 1 hour into the future, the times-
	      tamp  contains the year instead of the time of day.

       -o
	      Presents file permissions (if -l option)	in  octal
	      mode, not in symbolic mode.

       -F
	      Append a character to each file name indicating the
	      file type.  For regular files that are  executable,
	      append a `*'.  The file type indicators are `/' for
	      directories, `@' for symbolic links, `|' for FIFOs,
	      `=' for sockets, and nothing for regular files.

       -R
	      List the contents of all directories recursively.

       -u
	      Do not sort directory contents; list them in  what-
	      ever  order  they  are  stored  on  the disk.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
