DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of chgrp. It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.Also, all options are missing.

       chgrp  changes  the  group ownership of each given file to
       the given group, which can be the numeric group ID or  the
       group name.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
