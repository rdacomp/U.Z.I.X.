NAME
       uniq - remove duplicate lines from a sorted file

USAGE
       uniq [-cduzN.M+L] [-fields] [+letters] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version  of uniq. It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.Also,many options are missing.

       uniq prints the unique lines in a sorted file,  discarding
       all but one of a run of matching lines.	It can optionally
       show only lines that appear exactly once,  or  lines  that
       appear more than once.  uniq requires sorted input because
       it compares only consecutive lines.

       uniq writes to the standard output. If the input  file  is
       not specified, it reads from the standard input.

OPTIONS
       -u
	      Only print unique lines.

       -d
	      Only print duplicate lines.

       -c
	      Print the number of times each line occurred  along
	      with the line.

       -z
	      As -c, but print octal numbers.

       -N.M   Skip over the first N  words  before  checking  for
	      uniqueness. Skip over the first M letters  (in  the
	      indicated field).  Note  that  fields  are  skipped
	      before letters.

       +L     Compare only L letters.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
