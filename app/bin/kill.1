NAME
       kill - kill a process from your system

USAGE
       kill [-signal] pid ....

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of kill. It's  been
       significantly  shortened,   but	not  many  features  have
       actually been removed. However, there may  be  differences
       from the GNU version.

       kill's usual use is to remove stray  processes  from  your
       system, kill is sometimes  used	for  different	purposes,
       such   as  telling  programs  different	things	with  the
       {-signal} option.

EXAMPLES
       For example to kill a program that's running  at  1024,	I
       would type:

	   kill -9 1024

       This would send signal 9 to the program, and  the  program
       will then quit.

OPTIONS
       -signal is the signal you  wish	to  send  to the  running
       process. Examples are HUP, INT, QUIT, KILL or 9.
