NAME
       mkdir - make directories

USAGE
       mkdir [-p] [-m mode] directory

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  documents	the  UZIX  version of mkdir. It's
       been significantly  scaled  down for inclusion in the UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.

       mkdir creates a new, empty directory on your disk.

OPTIONS
       -m {mode} set the mode of the created directory	to  mode,
       which is 0666 minus the bits set in your umask.

       -p create any non-existant parents for the supplied mask.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Quite a few  commands  are  missing
       from this release (and the extended GNU	equivilants,  ie:
       --parents).
