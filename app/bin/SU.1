NAME
       su - temporarily log in as superuser or another user

USAGE
       su [username]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version  of  su.  It's been
       scaled down for inclusion in the UZIX release, and doesn't
       have the help or version  commands  included  in  the  GNU
       release. Also, all options are missing.

       su  can  be used to temporarily login as another user.  It
       prompts for the superuser password.  If the correct  pass-
       word  is entered, su creates a shell with the desired uid.
       If no name is specified, root is  assumed.   To  exit  the
       temporary shell,  type  exit.  When memory is tight, it is
       better to become superuser by logging out and then logging
       in  again  as  root, rather than using su since the latter
       creates an extra shell in memory.  Any user  with  a  zero
       group id need not type a password.  This makes life easier
       for the system administrator.

EXAMPLES
       To become root, I'd type:
       su

       To become user 'fudeba', I'd type:
       su fudeba

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
