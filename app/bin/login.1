LOGIN(1)	UZIX System Administrator's Manual	 LOGIN(1)


NAME
       login - begin a session

USAGE
       login username

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version of login. It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release, and lacks many of the features you'd expect in	a
       modern version of login.

       Login is used to  start	a  new	session  on  the  current
       terminal. It's usually invoked by the login:  prompt,  but
       in UZIX's case it acts as a sort of miniature  getty  type
       program.

       You generally don't need to worry about login, all logins,
       etc are done automatically by the system.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
