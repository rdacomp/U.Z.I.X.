NAME
       dosdir - list an MS(X)-DOS directory

USAGE
       dosdir [-lr] drive

DESCRIPTION
       dosdir reads standard IBM PC / MSX diskettes or hard  disk
       partitions in MS(X)-DOS format and lists their contents on
       standard output. Directory names should contain slashes to
       separate components,even though MS(X)-DOS uses backslashes

       The names dosdir, dosread and doswrite and dosdel are  all
       links to the same program. The program sees which function
       to perform by seeing how it was called.

       A drive code of A causes the program to use /dev/dosA, for
       example, a link to /dev/fd0.  Similarly, to have hard disk
       partition 1 be DOS drive C, /dev/dosC could be a  link  to
       /dev/hd1, and so on for other drive codes. A normal device
       name may also be used instead of a drive code. And,  also,
       a drive code of A: causes the  program  to  use  /dev/fd0.
       Similarly, a drive code of C: causes the  program  to  use
       /dev/fd2.

OPTIONS
       -l     Long listing.

       -r     Recursively descend and print subdirectories.
