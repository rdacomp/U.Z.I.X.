NAME
       ln - make links between files

USAGE
       ln [-s] source... destination

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents the UZIX version  of  ln.	It's been
       significantly  scaled  down  for  inclusion  in	the  UZIX
       release, and doesn't have the  help  or	version  commands
       included in the GNU release.Also,many options are missing.

       ln make links between files. If the last argument names an
       existing directory, ln  links each other  given	file into
       a   file     with     the     same     name     in    that
       directory.  If only one file is given, it links that  file
       into  the current directory.  Otherwise, if only two files
       are given, it links the first onto the second.  It  is  an
       error  if  the  last  argument is not a directory and more
       than two files are given.  It makes hard links by default.

OPTIONS
       -s
	      Make symbolic links instead of  hard  links.   This
	      option produces an error message on systems that do
	      not support symbolic links.

BUGS
       This version  has  been	scaled	down  a  little  bit  for
       inclusion in the UZIX. Many options are missing from  this
       release, that many would expect from the GNU versions.
